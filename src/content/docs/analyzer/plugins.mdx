description: An overview of how to use Biome's Analyzer Plugins

:::note
Plugins are currently only available in the [2.0 beta release](/blog/biome-v2-0-beta).

Biome Analyzer supports [GritQL](/reference/gritql/) plugins. Currently, these
plugins allow you to match specific code patterns and register customized
diagnostic messages for them.

An example of a plugin is:

```grit
`$fn($args)` where {
    $fn <: `Object.assign`,
    register_diagnostic(
        span = $fn,
        message = "Prefer object spread instead of `Object.assign()`"
    )
}
```

You can put a GritQL snippet in a file anywhere in your project, but be mindful
you use the `.grit` extension. Then, you can simply enable it as a plugin with
the following configuration:

```
{
    "plugins": ["./path-to-plugin.grit"]
}
```

The plugin will now be enabled on all files the analyzer runs on.

## Plugin API

In addition to Grit's
[built-in functions](https://docs.grit.io/language/functions#built-in-functions),
Biome currently supports one extra function:

### `register_diagnostic()`

Registers a diagnostic to be reported whenever the pattern matches.

Requires two arguments:

- `span`: The syntax node to attach the diagnostic to. This is typically a
  variable that you matched within a code snippet.
- `message`: The message to show with the diagnostic.
